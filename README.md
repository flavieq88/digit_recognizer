## Digit Recognizer

This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network implemented with Tensorflow to classify images of handwritten digits. 

The images are from the MNIST dataset.

The model achieved a 99.2% accuracy. I also show the confusion matrix.

To run the model, activate a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

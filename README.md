# Digit Recognizer

This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network implemented with Tensorflow to classify images of handwritten digits. 

The images are from the MNIST dataset.



# Installation
Clone the repository. Then, activate a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results
The model achieved a 99% accuracy. I have also generated the confusion matrix.

## References
I loosely followed a tutorial found on the Tensorflow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn.
